# Introduction
this was an exercice giving to me for a job interview at Lab-Box

The objective of this exercise is to understand your approach in different sectors:

- The architecture you put in place
- The overall quality of the code (performance, security, stability,...)
- Your tech stack choices

<aside>
☝ You are free to build all of the exercise or just a part of it, do a basic version or a full-featured one

# Process

The first step is to build the application. The complete scope is up to you, as well as the deadline.

When you feel ready, please come back to me to set up a meeting to review the final product and the related source code. During that meeting, the focus will be on discussing the choices you made, the priorities you took, the reason why you implemented function X but maybe not function Y, ...

<aside>
☝ If you have questions about the exercise, to have more information for instance, just take a hypothesis and go with that.

# Exercise

The application, called "Find my lunch", is a web application that lists the different restaurants that are available around me for my today's lunch.

## Components

It consists of different components:

- A backend with a database of restaurants
- A webpage where I can "tell" where I am, which then lists me a list of available nearby restaurants

## Stack

In terms of the tech stack, there is only one condition: backend-side code must be written in NodeJS. Any framework, DB, or external service is open for you to choose and use.

## Functionalities

A few functionalities can be implemented as well, such as:

- Input validation
- Caching
- Testing
- Anything you think would improve the app

# Deliverables

- The app must be publicly accessible to test
- The source code must be available on Github to review, along with all the related commits (not 1 big commit with all the code)
